Let's start with some terms:
    actionCreator: fabric to create action cretors
    ActionCreator: the instance of actionCreator

This is how we crate very basic ActionCreator:

The action which was created looks like this:

action satisfies FSA standart. We can see that type is already defined,
payload - undefined, error initially is set to false, 
meta consists of creatorArgs array which is filled up by the arguments of actionCreator call

Payload is set by the first argument of creator() call
All arguments we can find in creatorArgs array

If payload is the instance of Error, then ActionCreator automatically sets error property to true

By default all instances of ActionCreator receive a unique type
You can set type by passing it as actionCreator parameter (it should be string or symbol)

You can manage creation of actions with enhancer functions. You can read about them later

With the help of commandCreator you can create actions which execute sideeffects (async actions) only

commandCreator is nothing but alias

You can try borex plugin for babel. It automatically (?) and passes it as first argument to actionCreator
